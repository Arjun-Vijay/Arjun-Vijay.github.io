Hi, I’m Arjun -- a Software Engineer based out of Atlanta, GA.

I received my B.S in Computer Science from the George Washington University in 2021 and currently work on a Solutions Delivery Team at the SAIC Innovation Factory. In my free time, I love playing tennis, guitar, and chess.

If you’d like to get in touch, please feel free to send me an email or reach out via LinkedIn.
