Hi, I’m Arjun, a Software Engineer based out of Atlanta, GA.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the George Washington University in 2021 and currently work as a Software Engineer at the SAIC Innovation Factory.

In my free time I love playing tennis, going on runs, and playing guitar. If you’d like to get in touch, please feel free to send me an email or reach out via social media.
